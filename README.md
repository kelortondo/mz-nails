<!-- This is optional and it is used to give the user info on how to use the project after installation. This could be added in the Installation section also. -->

# Development
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

<!-- This is the place where you give instructions to developers on how to modify the code.

You could give **instructions in depth** of **how the code works** and how everything is put together.

You could also give specific instructions to how they can setup their development environment.

Ideally, you should keep the README simple. If you need to add more complex explanations, use a wiki. Check out [this wiki](https://github.com/navendu-pottekkat/nsfw-filter/wiki) for inspiration. -->
